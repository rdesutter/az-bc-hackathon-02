1001,Ghost Lector SF Worldcup,Carbon frame hardtail crosscountry bike with high-end components.,The Ghost Lector World Cup 30 2024 MTB bicycle,5799,5219.1,hardtail,Ghost_Lector_SF.png
1002,Trek Supercaliber SLR ,Direct feel with capable geometry,"The Trek Supercaliber SLR 9.9 XX AXS Gen 2 is a thoroughbred cross-country race bike, delivering razor-sharp handling and a direct feel under power. With its IsoStrut rear shock partially hidden in the top tube, the Supercaliber is intended to offer the efficiency of a hardtail with the comfort of rear suspension. Pair this with the updated and more capable geometry and you have a bike that balances efficiency and composure. ",10800,9720,fully,Trek-Supercaliber.png
1003,Vitus Rapide FS CRX,Balanced modern geometry and smooth suspension,"Vitus Rapide FS CRX is a great performing full-suspension cross-country bike that packs a punch with its value-for-money spec. The unidirectional carbon frame utilises a four-bar linkage system and a flexstay design to deliver 100mm of suspension travel. One look at the geometry sheet tells us Vitus has drawn from its experience in the trail and enduro market for the Rapides design � the reach comes in at 500mm in size large. The head angle, at 67 degrees, is also rather slack and the 77-degree effective seat tube is bang on trend. The Vitus is decked out with some of the best components on the market, including a RockShox SID SL Ultimate fork and Shimano XT brakes.",3999,3599.1,fully,Vitus-Rapide.png
1004,YT Izzo Uncaged 7,A riot of a descender that still climbs like the best of them,"With the Izzo, German direct-to-consumer brand YT has entered the world of XC with a bang. Packing 120mm of suspension controlled by a four-bar linkage, the Izzo Uncaged 7�s carbon frame also features adjustable geometry. A flip chip offers 0.4 degrees of adjustment to the head and seat tube angles and a 5mm bottom bracket height adjustment, enabling riders to set their bike up to suit a variety of trails.",6299,5669.1,fully,YT-Izzo.png
1005,BMC Fourstroke 01 Two AXS,Decent geometry and an eager climber,"BMC�s Fourstroke piloted Tom Pidcock to Olympic Gold. On our trails, it made for a fairly poised race-ready ripper. The Fourstroke�s geometry is up-to-date and it climbs with near-impeccable pedalling manners. It pumps through rolling terrain well and the bike eggs you on to accelerate and push yourself towards your limits on a wide variety of trails. The SRAM GX Eagle AXS drivetrain performed flawlessly and the Fox suspension package felt supple.",8300,7470,fully,BMC-Fourstroke.png
1006,Cannondale Scalpel HT Carbon 4,Impressive all-round capability,"The Scalpel HT Carbon 4 is the most affordable bike in the Scalpel line-up, aimed at the gnarlier end of cross-country. Cannondale has evolved the typical XC race geometry by offering slacker head angles, giving the Scalpel HT handling character similar to an enduro bike. Steeper seat tube angles retain climbing ability and we were impressed by the traction provided by the zones in the rear triangle.",2600,2340,hardtail,Cannondale.png
1007,Giant Anthem Advanced Pro 29 1,Excellent modern geometry,"The Giant Anthem saw a refresh in late 2021 with updated geometry, a longer 110mm-travel suspension fork, and flexible seatstays and chainstay to simulate the articulation of a pivot point. This particular model uses the Fox Live Valve suspension system. The system has electronic link sensors on the fork and frame, which automatically open and close the fork and shock�s compression circuit when a bump is detected. With its modern geometry, the bike climbs reasonably well, although there is some bob. Heading downhill, the bike feels stable and secure over loose surfaces with supple suspension (Live Valve settings-dependent).",7500,6750,fully,Giant-Anthem.png
1008,Intense Sniper XC Expert,Composed on climbs and descents,"Although Intense is best known for its gravity-oriented bikes, the Sniper XC has an engaging ride quality that�s fast around a cross-country race course. The geometry is nice and modern, with a long 468mm reach and a 67.5-degree head tube angle, which is slack for a cross-country bike. The Sniper climbs well, bearing in mind there is no remote lockout. There is some pedal bob though, especially when sprinting. The bike descends assuredly, offering a smooth ride on rough descents while maintaining stiffness.",3699,3329.1,fully,Intense-Sniper.png
1009,Merida Ninety-Six RC 9000,A classic-feeling race bike with inspired handling manners,"Although Merida�s Ninety-Six seems conventional with its 100mm of suspension travel front and rear, it features trail-friendly geometry with a 68.5-degree head tube angle and a steep 76-degree seat tube angle. The bike features a Shimano XTR groupset, Fox Factory-level suspension and own-brand finishing kit. We found it to be a rocket ship up the climbs, with the active suspension helping you maintain speed up rough and loose climbs. It has plenty of character through corners thanks to its reactive steering. On descents, the Ninety-Six is slightly more nervous than the long reach would suggest.",8900,8010,fully,Merida-Ninety-Six.png
1010,Pivot LES SL 29 Pro XTR,Geometry inspires confidence,"Pivot's LES SL is a carbon race bike with clean lines and an innovative carbon construction, in that the frames are moulded from the inside out to reduce imperfections. The carbon frames have also been optimised to provide the same ride feel, whatever the size. The bike climbs well, with the frame feeling stiff but not to the point of being harsh. The winning geometry also means there's room to shift your weight around to maintain traction. Heading down the other side, the LES SL handles well, thanks to its moderately long reach, head tube angle and 60mm stem. It holds its speed well over chattery trails and the handling feels precise.",6750,6075,hardtail,Pivot-LES-SL.png
1011,Santa Cruz Blur C X01 AXS RSV,The brand lightest cross-country bike yet,"This Santa Cruz Blur is a bang-up-to-date cross-country mountain bike, with 100mm of suspension travel both front and rear. The Blur's geometry is just right � not so long and slack to feel sluggish, but stable enough for descents. The bike offers a precise and composed ride, descending with plenty of confidence. It�s comfortable, fast and reactive, making it ideal for short races or marathon events.",9149,8234.1,fully,Santa-Cruz-Blur.png
1012,Scott Spark RC Team Issue AXS,A radical but modern XC bike with an internal shock layout,"Scott�s latest Spark RC underwent quite a radical update, getting a new internal shock suspension layout and upping the travel to 120mm at both ends. Despite the shock not being visible, setting up the Spark was incredibly easy and there�s a sag meter printed on the non-driveside seat tube and seatstay junction for guidance. The updates result in a bike that�s dominant on the descents, despite not being specced with a dropper seatpost or particularly wide handlebars. Grip is excellent uphill and Scott�s TwinLoc remote lockout lever is incredibly easy to control from the bar.",4699,4229.1,fully,Scott-Spark-RC.png
1013,Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup,eacts to pedal input like a hardtail,"The Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup is unapologetically XC race-focused. The bike is an exceptional climber, thanks in part to the tyres and Roval Contact SL wheelset. Pedal bob is virtually eliminated when you run the rear shock in its �No Gulp� setting, making the Epic feel a lot like a hardtail. The 75mm of rear travel takes the sting out of descents rather than flattering your skills, but with a bit more thought, the bike can certainly compete against 120mm-travel XC race bikes.",12000,10800,fully,Specialized-Epic.png
